"""A profile of one installation as a new own profile of another one (page "Übertragen").

The rules follow FINDINGS, "Übertragung OrcaSlicer → SnOrca":
- Between two different slicers the copy is a root profile: every value of the source's chain,
  no template. The target may lack the templates, or have other values under their names, and a
  copy must not change when the target's templates change. Between two installations of the same
  slicer an own profile stays the child of its template, if the target has it.
- Every value the target knows for this kind (orfix/options.json), as a string or a list as the
  target defines them. Some keys hold two values in one list: standard and high-flow hotend in
  Snapmaker Orca (["265", "280"]), extruder variants in OrcaSlicer 2.5. The other slicer has no
  place for the second one, so between different slicers such a key keeps its first value, the
  plan names it; Snapmaker Orca then takes that value for both hotends. "nil" only where the
  target allows it, an enum choice only if the target has it; otherwise the key goes and the
  target takes its default. A value the target cannot read would make it delete the profile.
- The printers: those of the source's list the target has, by name. An empty list stays empty,
  i.e. every printer. If none of them is there, the copy is refused.
- The name: an own profile keeps its name. A system profile gets its source in brackets, without
  "@System" or "@base": "Elegoo PLA (Orca)". An own file with the name of a system profile stays
  unloaded once the target ships that profile, and the brackets show where it came from.
  OrcaSlicer binds an own root filament with an empty printer list to the text after "@"
  (FINDINGS 4.4), so there such a name has no "@".
