"""The page "Änderungen": what changed in an installation since the user last marked it seen,
e.g. after an update, a login or a cloud sync (PLAN 1.4). A snapshot per installation in
data/snapshots/<id>.json keeps the state of then as flat items. OrcaOne compares profiles rather
than files: OrcaSlicer 2.5 keeps all system profiles in a few .opc files, and a name says more
than a file. What OrcaOne writes itself counts as seen (accept(), from operations.apply). Writes
only into OrcaOne's own folder.

Items, key -> value:
    slicer                  "header" of the .conf, e.g. "Snapmaker Orca 2.4.0"
    folder                  the user folder the slicer reads: logged in or not (FINDINGS 4.2)
    package/<name>          version of a vendor package in system/
    printer/<model>         {"vendor", "nozzles"} of an entry in "models"
    visible                 "list" with a "filaments" list, else "all" (FINDINGS 4.3)
    visible/<name>          a name in that list
    system/<kind>/<name>    [package, hash of the resolved values] of a selectable system profile
    own/<kind>/<name>       the whole file of an own profile, credentials only as a hash; None
                            if the slicer cannot read it
